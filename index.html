            "A common stereotype of the homeless population is that they are all alcoholics or drug abusers. The truth is that a high percentage of homeless people do struggle with substance abuse, but addictions should be viewed as illnesses and require a great deal of treatment, counseling, and support to overcome. Substance abuse is both a cause and a result of homelessness, often arising after people lose their housing"

                Substance abuse is often a cause of homelessness. Addictive disorders disrupt relationships with family
  and friends and often cause people to lose their jobs. For people who are already struggling to pay their
  bills, the onset or exacerbation of an addiction may cause them to lose their housing. A 2008 survey by
  the United States Conference of Mayors asked 25 cities for their top three causes of homelessness.
  Substance abuse was the single largest cause of homelessness for single adults (reported by 68% of cities).
  Substance abuse was also mentioned by 12% of cities as one of the top three causes of homelessness for
  families. According to Didenko and Pankratz (2007), two-thirds of homeless people report that drugs
  and/or alcohol were a major reason for their becoming homeless.
