        Why should we care about the homeless?
      </h4>
      <p id="color_change"> 
        The average number of homeless in america is between 2.3 and 3.5 million people that are homeless in amercia. This map show how many people in differnt states are homeless or just don't got
        no money to buy food. Half of the people thats on the map are mom and dads that have kids. Most selther don't take some family in. Which is sad because everyone should be help as much as they can. People that are homeless can't afford the
        things we can afford. For Example, they can't buy clothes for them selfs. They can't afford to buy soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, Ect. Its worst for the woman that are homeless. They need things for there hygiene. But they can't get 
        it because they cant afford it.

        Everyday people walk pass homeless people like they nothing or they not human. They look down on them like it was there fault. Or they choose to be homeless.  People see them asking for spare change or some food. but they ignore them and walk away.
        Some people don't understand what it is to be cold outside with out no blanket, or the right weather clothes. Its another reason why people don't give the homeless money. Some homeless use the money they get for drugs. Other use it for clothes, food and things they need.

        It all happened in 2002 when I was 1 and a half years old. My mom had a house with my dad but my dad left her with all these bills and she had no job at the time. Then we started living in other people's house, like my family. They didn't have room for all of us, I have 3 siblings, so we had to find somewhere else to go. We tried to live in shelters, but they couldn't take us in because they either didn't have room or they were selfish. 
        That's when we started living on the street. My mom gave all her kids to other people, like I went to my dad, my sister went to my grandma, and my brother went to his grandma. But my mom still had no place to live. She started to look for a job but nobody would hire her because her job experiences weren't good. It took her
        about two years to get a job and she had a job at a fast food restaurant, and then she started saving her money and got a house. She got a better job and by 2013 she got all of her kids back and now we all live in her house. Even when we were homeless my mom still made our lives fun because she wanted to make us happy no matter what.
        Plus, she didn't want us to know we were homeless and she would play games with us and give us any food she got.

        Technically I was homeless with my dad for a month. I had to hide this from my mom. My parents are separated and my dad wanted to keep me for the weeks he had me and I had to hide from my mom that we were living in a house that we were supposed to be living in. The house was technically "our house" by law, but the landlord kicked us out. We lived there before he found someone to take our place. But the last week he kicked us out and we had to live 
        in our car and lived behind the McDonald's by 52nd street. I never told my mom so she still doesn't know to this day. At first I didn't exactly realize that we were homeless, but as I did realize it didn't bother me until my dad had to try to get some food and some guy tried to steal the car I was sleeping in. I ended up hitting him with the frying pan in my car, he passed out in the car seat, my dad came back and saw him. The brother other of the man was wondering
        what was taking so long so he tried to pull me out of the car, so I hit him with the frying pan too. I did the first thing that my mom would do, hit him with the frying pan. Then me and my dad left them on the sidewalk and drove our car to somewhere else. Within the next week, his job finally paid him for the month and we moved into a house three blocks from our last house was.
        That's one of the main stories I remember, there were a couple others as well. This is the funniest, all the others were just random.

        I had a close friend from a long time ago. At one point in his life he was living in his car. Then his car got taken away so he was living in the streets. He went to a homeless shelter and they helped him get rehabilitated and he started boxing. He had a wealthy trainer that started training him and now he's a famous boxer on TV. He didn't go to college but now has a Lexus and wears all designer. I box with him now. He boxes on TV professionally now. He's really well-off now and doesn't have to work besides boxing.
