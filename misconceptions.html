      Top 3 Misconceptions about Drug Abuse
    </h2>
    <p class="misconception-text">
      <b class="bold">Misconception 1: Quitting is just a matter of willpower</b>
      <br>
      While the initial choice to start doing drugs is voluntary for most people, 
      the decision to stop by themselves is not just an easy exercise of willpower.
      <br>
      According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), 
      those who abuse drugs for a long period of time have 
      “changes in areas of the brain that are critical to 
      judgment, decision making, learning and memory, and behavior control.“
      <br>
      So the lack of willpower is a symptom of drug abuse, not the continued cause.
      <br>
      <b class="bold">Misconception 2: Addicts should quit “cold turkey”</b>
      <br>
      Giving up drugs “cold turkey” (abruptly rather than gradually) 
      is harder than you think because of the harshness of physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms. 
      Many users only continue to keep abusing drugs to avoid the withdrawal symptoms.
      <br>
      That’s why NIDA suggests a two-step process 
      including addiction treatment medications with behavioral therapy 
      to gradually reduce the harshness of the withdrawal symptoms, 
      rather than trying to fight it with willpower alone.
      <br>
      In addition, the withdrawal symptoms may be so bad 
      in some cases that they can become life-threatening.
      <br>
      <b class="bold">Misconception 3: You’re just exchanging one addiction 
        for another if you need anti-addiction drugs to control your urges.</b>
      <br>
      It does seem counter intuitive to treat drugs with more drugs, 
      but NIDA states that the FDA approved anti-addiction drugs allow the brain to “function more normally” 
      because they “enable the addicted person to leave behind a life of crime and drug abuse.”
      <br>
      Anti addiction medications like Buprenorphine, which is used to treat opiates and Heroin, 
      act on the same receptors in your brain that opiates and heroin act on, 
      but without producing the same level of dependence or withdrawal symptoms. 
      There are no adverse effects when taken correctly.
      <br>
      The key is taking the anti-addiction medication is being consistent with them, 
      which is what you get while being under the professional care in a detox facility.
