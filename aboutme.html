         I chose this topic because it's close to me as family members have been through substance abuse. I've learned that there is a stigma against people who abuse drugs rather than trying to help them.
         My favorite part about web development is trying to figure out answers to problems that we face.

          I chose this topic because me and my family have been through it and I know how it feels. I've learned that it affects more people than I thought it would be.
          My favorite part about web development is helping people think differently when they see homeless people.

         I like working with this group because it's fun to learn things about drug abuse and homelessness that I didn't know before. As an intern, I've learned that there's still a lot I don't know.
         My favorite part about web development is running into problems because it helps me know how to not run into them next time.
